# 💓 Heart Disease Prediction Web App

This is a Machine Learning–based web application that predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on user medical input. It is built using **Streamlit**, **scikit-learn**, and **Plotly** for interactive prediction and visualization.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🧠 Predict heart disease risk using a trained ML model (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
- 📊 Interactive charts to explore heart disease trends based on user input
- 💾 Automatically logs each prediction into a CSV file
- 🔍 Real-time confidence score for prediction
- 📈 Visual analysis of trends using Plotly histograms

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python
- Streamlit
- scikit-learn
- pandas, numpy
- seaborn, matplotlib, plotly
- pickle (for saving model)
- ucimlrepo (optional, for data fetching)

---

## 🧬 Machine Learning Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handle missing values (`thal`, `ca`)
   - Feature selection via Random Forest, RFE, Chi-Square test
   - Optional: Scaling with `RobustScaler`

2. **Model Training**
   - Models used: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM
   - Model evaluation using accuracy, F1 score, precision, recall
   - Best result: 91% accuracy (binary classification)

3. **Model Deployment**
   - Exported trained model using `pickle`
   - Deployed via Streamlit UI

## 💻 How to Run Locally

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/heart-disease-predictor.git
cd heart-disease-predictor
````

### 2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run the Streamlit app

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
